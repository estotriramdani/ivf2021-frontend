             Our laboratories and expertise have transformed many ideas into reality, have  resolved many customer´s problem, and have conducted countless stability tests for  our customer.  <br><br>
             
             In addition to our application laboratory facilities, all of our sales staffs offer  many years experience in food industry, very strong technical background, and  excellent product knowledge that can not be provided by many companies. This is  why our company has chosen to be only focusing in specialized natural food  ingredients that brings value and innovation for our customer.

             <strong>1. Full range of clean label colouring foods ingredients <br><br></strong>

             We carry a complete clean label coloring foods range from yellow, orange,  green, red, for almost any kind of food applications. Clean label coloring food is the  next generation of natural colour that is better, safer, and closer to nature. It is NOT  chemically processed in any way, and NOT added with any chemical ingredients.  This makes our coloring foods suitable for any product application (inlcuding baby and toddler product) and easier if you want to export your product to any country  around the world. <br><br>

             Clean label coloring food means all of our colour are from various juice  concentrate from pumpkin, grapes, radish, blueberries, etc, that is so safe and edible  at any stage that you can directly consume the color itself. <br><br>

             In Indonesia, our company was one of the very first few companies who  promote and educate market about natural colours. To ensure that we only deliver the  best and freshest product possible, 100% of our colour are imported by air and stored  at refrigerated warehouse due to the more sensitive nature and shorter shelf life of  Colouring Foods.   <br><br> 

             We also deliver all of our products in refrigerated condition to guarantee our  customers always receive the highest quality product possible. <br><br>

After more than 15  years, our company has successfully made a Danish culture company to capture  almost 100% market share of culture in Indonesia and become one of the very few  companies who can provide very strong formulation and technical support in  fermented dairy product application.  <br><br>

            Due to our 15 years experience in the fermented dairy industries, we are one of  the very few companies who has the most knowledge and able to give technical and  non technical advise for various fermented products. <br><br>
