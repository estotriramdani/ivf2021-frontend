## How To Start This Project

- Clone this project
- Install "Live Sass Compiler" extension in VS Code
- **Watch Sass**
- And the compiled CSS will be stored in "css" folder as main.css (you can view the setting on **.vscode/settins.json**.

> I would strongly recommend you to use another VS Code extension, **Live Server**, to get a rapid development.

Please keep main.scss file clean (main.scss is only for importing another .scss files).
Always remember, don't edit compiled css file (main.css) directly on its file because it will be overridden whenever scss is being compiled.
